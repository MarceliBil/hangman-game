A simple game with a really nice code, written with pure JavaScript.

Demo: https://hangman-game-mb.netlify.app

Arrays and their methods are used, although it can also be done with, for example, strings and loops.

Game assumptions:
- the phrase to guess is random and provided by the API
- after each mistake, another element of the gallows appears
- there is a maximum of 10 chances to guess the phrase

The phrases provided by the API are quite difficult, so if you can't guess them, check out the Devtools console.
